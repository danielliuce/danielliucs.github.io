                        This month was an onboarding month that was mainly for the team to get to know one another.
                        We were assigned our projects this month and I would be working on maintaining and extending the 
                        website of the hackathon as well as creating a new dashboard

                        I started off this internship without any knowledge in Python, Machine Learning, or Federated Learning.
                        I quickly learned Python and the basic concepts of federated learning within my first two days of the internship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the next <strong>two weeks</strong>, I took a deeper dive into learning the concepts of reinforcement learning from the book: <i>Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-on</i>
                        by Maxim Lapan. I studied only select chapters related to what would be present during this internship. Specifically chapters 1->7, 9->11.
                        The hands on code that I wrote for each chapter from the book can be found on my public repositories on my github.
                      
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third week was when I started running experiments for a paper that was worked on before I arrived for this internship.
                        I also edited existing plots for previous experiments in this paper as well as write code to find the average reward at every
                        10k timestep of these experiments. This paper propsed an algorithm <i>Lethe</i> that was for continual reinforcement learning which
                        aimed to forget previous tasks that interfered with the current task so that agents can adapt and converge quicker
                        to newer tasks. It used a prioritized replay buffer based on an interference metric that encourages the agent to focus on
                        samples from the new task when the gradients of previous tasks conflict with the new one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After Lethe was submitted, the fourth week was when I started to work on extending the federated learning framework <i><a href="https://github.com/TL-System/plato">Plato</a></i>
                    </p>

                        This entire month was mainly dedicated to extending the framework Plato as this took many hours of debuggging
                        since it was a distributed system framework. Not only was the task to merely extend Plato, we also had to implement
                        our own ideas into the extension for another paper <b><i>(Shoal)</i></b> submission. More details about this project can be found
                        <a href="projects.html">here</a>

                        This month was when I started to help with experiments to test out the performance of our idea with curriculum federated reinforcement learning.
                        There were so many experiments ran across different seeds that I lost count but if I had to take a guess I think there were around 100
                        different experiments conducted to compare perfomrance between already exisitng federated learning algorithms and ours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also wrote extendible code to combine an arbitrary number of dataframes from the different experiments, calculate their average cumulative sum rewards across seeds as well
                        as just their average rewards across seeds. This code also plotted these combined dataframes to get a better visual on the performance between different 
                        algorithms. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The end of this month is also the deadline to the <strong>INFOCOM 2023 Conference</strong> which is the 
                        conference where Shoal would be submitted.

                    This month was where I focused on extending Plato's api into a new design pattern using a factory design pattern. I then updated the source code of the algorithms I implemented the month prior to support this new API.
