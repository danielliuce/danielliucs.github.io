            <h3>
              <b style="color:#094ae2"> Extension of Federated Learning Framework <a href=https://github.com/TL-System/plato/tree/continual_RL> Plato</a></b>
              <br>
              <i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw margin-top large"></i> <span style="font-size:70%">May 2022 -
                <b>Current</b></span>
              
              <p style="font-size:65%">I helped extend this framework by supporting reinforcement learning training on clients. I worked on
              two reinforcement learning algorithms (<a href="https://github.com/TL-System/plato/tree/continual_RL/examples/park_env" ><b>A2C</b></a> & <a href="https://github.com/TL-System/plato/tree/continual_RL/examples/td3_learning" ><b>TD3</b></a> ) 
              for clients to use and then used federated averaging to aggregate the clients
              to the server. I also helped make custom actor and critic models used in both A2C & TD3 as well as a custom algorithm for the server to
              communication with the clients</p>
              <p style="font-size:65%">Curriculum learning was then implemented with these algorithms and then experiments were ran on the adaptive bit rate environment found in  <a href=https://github.com/park-project/park> park</a>
              with three tasks and three seeds. I then developed code to combine dataframes, take the averages and cumulative sum and ploted them. 
              Comparing curriculum learning showed better results than the classic federated averaging algorithm</p>

              <b style="color:#094ae2"> Processor Design Project</b>
              <br>
              <i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw w3-margin-top w3-large"></i> <span style="font-size:70%">Apr 2022</span>
              <p style="font-size: 65%"> This was a project I worked on with a good friend of mine Dante Crescenzi (insert his website here)
              This processor was 16 bits with 8 total registers and implemented using Verilog. I implemented assembly language instructions such as
              <b>mov, movt, add, sub, ldr, str, and, b</b> and things such as flag checking. 
              Dante then extended the processor to support instructions such as <b>push, pop, bl, cmp, lsl, lsr, asr, ror</b>.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size: 65%">Overall, this project taught me a lot about how a processor works and the verilog behind it. Concepts such as
              FSM timing diagrams were used to implement instructions on the correct clock cycle along with ModelSim debugging were extensively practiced.
              <br>
              Due to the restrictions of academic integrity set in place by my Univeristy, I am unable to share the project folder publicly on this website but they 
              are availaible upon demand.

              <b style="color:#094ae2"> <a href="https://devpost.com/software/gotime-jbksxl">GoTime</a> - NewHacks Hackathon Project, <i>4th Place Winner</i></b>
              <br>
              <i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw w3-margin-top w3-large"></i> <span style="font-size:70%">November 7th 2021</span>

              <p style="font-size:65%">This was a 24 hour Hackathon. It's where I first learned about Dijkstras algorithm and how it finds us the shortest
                possible path inside a graph. I mainly worked on the algorithm and it was then integrated with the frontend to launch 
                a web app.The main goal of this web app was to allow University of Toronto students to have a more <i><b>efficient schedule</b></i> than what is 
                currently in place. 
               
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:65%">
                Currently, an example for students with three lectures will have
                students sometimes start at Bahen, walk up to Sidney Smith, and walk back to Bahen. 
                Making students have two classes in Bahen and then their third and last one at Sidney Smith would be more efficient.
                This is what our web app aimed to do, minimize walking by rearranging schedules more efficiently. More details can be found
                at the projects link.
              </p>

              <p style="font-size:65%">
                Overall, the hackathon was lots of work as I was just at my computer for almost 24 hours
                but I learned a lot and it was fun.
