    <h3>Some Ideas I would like to put on this website</h3>
    <p>
      <ul> 
      <li> Personal Calender </li>
      <li> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... A calender that tracks tasks I have to do per
      week, one I can enter tasks/things to do  </li>
      <li>A portfolio, similar to what is seen on github  </li>
      <li> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... This will keep track of projects I have worked on
      with source code and maybe demos of it working? </li>
      <li> An about me section </li>
      <li> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... This will probably be about me and stuff &nbsp; </li>
      <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp ... Maybe add what I'm currently doing and what I want to do
      in the future</li>
      <li>An integration of react maybe after I integrate javascript and more css</li></ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Motivation on why to do this</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
      <li> You spent 30 dollars on the yearly domain, make good use of it or else you
      just wasted a lot of money </li>
      <li> You want to go into your PEY job with frontend skills and not be a one
      trick pansy with only backend skills </li>
      <li> You have so much time in the summer that you won't have in the semester </li> </ul>
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
      I wake up in the morning: <br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...I go on my phone <br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...I start extend plato for 8 hours <br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...I use ressources from
      <abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network"> iQua </abbr> to extend plato
      <br />
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... After work I see if I am in the mood for some
      leetcode, if not I will try to learn some HTML or go on my phone
      <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... At night I hit the gym before I go to bed
    </p>
