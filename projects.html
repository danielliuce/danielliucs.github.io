                    <p style="font-size:65%">I helped extend this framework by supporting reinforcement learning
                        training on
                        clients. This extension allowed popular federated learning algorithms such as FedAvg and FedADP
                        aggregate clients that used
                        reinforcement learning. </p>
                    <p style="font-size:65%">
                        I worked on
                        two reinforcement learning algorithms (<a
                            href="https://github.com/TL-System/plato/tree/continual_RL/examples/park_env"><b>A2C</b></a>
                        & <a
                            href="https://github.com/TL-System/plato/tree/continual_RL/examples/td3_learning"><b>TD3</b></a>
                        )
                        to train the clients and then used federated averaging to aggregate the clients
                        to the server. I also helped in creating custom actor and critic models used in both A2C & TD3 as well
                        as a
                        custom algorithm for the server to
                        communicate with the clients</p>
                    <p style="font-size:65%">Curriculum learning was then implemented with the aggregation algorithm federated averaging
                        to aggregate only select clients. Experiments
                        were ran on the adaptive bit rate environment found in <a
                            href=https://github.com/park-project/park>
                            park</a>
                        with three tasks and three seeds to test out the performance against other state of the art algorithms.
                        Comparing curriculum learning showed better results than the classic federated learning
                        algorithms such as FedAvg & FedADP</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 65%"> This was a project I worked on with a good friend of mine Dante Crescenzi
                        (insert
                        his website here)
                        This processor was 16 bits with 8 total registers and implemented using Verilog. I implemented
                        assembly
                        language instructions such as
                        <b>mov, movt, add, sub, ldr, str, and, b</b> and things such as flag checking.
                        Dante then extended the processor to support instructions such as <b>push, pop, bl, cmp, lsl,
                            lsr, asr,
                            ror</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 65%">Overall, this project taught me a lot about how a processor works and the
                        verilog
                        behind it. Concepts such as
                        FSM timing diagrams were used to implement instructions on the correct clock cycle along with
                        ModelSim
                        debugging were extensively practiced.

                    <p style="font-size:65%">This was a 24 hour Hackathon. It's where I first learned about Dijkstras
                        algorithm
                        and how it finds us the shortest
                        possible path inside a graph. I mainly worked on the algorithm and it was then integrated with
                        the
                        frontend to launch
                        a web app.The main goal of this web app was to allow University of Toronto students to have a
                        more
                        <i><b>efficient schedule</b></i> than what is
                        currently in place.

                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size:65%">
                        Currently, an example for students with three lectures will have
                        students sometimes start at Bahen, walk up to Sidney Smith, and walk back to Bahen.
                        Making students have two classes in Bahen and then their third and last one at Sidney Smith
                        would be more
                        efficient.
                        This is what our web app aimed to do, minimize walking by rearranging schedules more
                        efficiently. More
                        details can be found
                        at the projects link.

                    <p style="font-size:65%">
                        Overall, the hackathon was lots of work as I was just at my computer for almost 24 hours
                        but I learned a lot and it was fun.
